# Describe Sample
## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future 💼
When I was a child, I harbored ``ˈhɑːrbərd`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I was thought about performing on stage and receiving ``rɪˈsiːvɪŋ`` applause ``əˈplɔːz``. However, as I grew older, my mindset changed ``tʃeɪndʒd``. It’s just dawned ``dɔːnd`` on me that being a singer isn't the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized ``ˈriːəlaɪzd`` that I'm not born to become a singer. I have no knack ``næk`` for singing and don't have the natural talent required ``rɪˈkwaɪərd`` to master in this field. Additionally, I don't have what it takes to become a successful singer. You know, the dedication ``ˌdɛdɪˈkeɪʃən``, vocal skills, and stage presence ``ˈprɛzəns`` needed are beyond my capabilities ``ˌkeɪpəˈbɪlɪtiz``.

Moreover, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The long hours of practice and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming ``ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmɪŋ``. The lack of privacy makes me feel particularly ``pərˈtɪkjʊlɚli`` challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream, I have come to understand that it's not a suitable career choice for me.

## Describe an occasion when you heard someone complaining about something in a restaurant / store or other business places
Last summer, I witnessed ``ˈwɪtnɪst`` a significant complaint while eating street food in Hanoi, specifically ``spi'sifikəli`` Bun Cha. It was around noon, in the heart ``hɑ:t`` of Hanoi’s Old Quarter ``'kwɔ:tə``, when a family sitting at the table next to mine showed **dissatis**faction ``ˌdɪsˌsætɪsˈfækʃən`` with their meal.

The mother made a complaint about the portions ``ˈpɔːrʃənz`` of grilled ``ɡrɪld`` pork being too small and the unsanitary ``ʌnˈsænɪˌtɛri`` dipping sauce. She insisted on getting a better meal and called the waiter over. You know, luckily, the waiter apologized ``əˈpɑːləˌdʒaɪzd`` to her that he would bring a fresh sauce and more pork.

You know, the mother's initial ``ɪˈnɪʃəl`` reaction had clearly ticked her off. I could tell she got pissed ``pɪst`` off because nothing is more important than hygiene ``ˈhaɪdʒiːn`` and quality when it comes to food. The waiter, however, remained calm and polite ``pəˈlaɪt``.

This experience made me realize ``ˈriːəlaɪz`` the importance of good customer service. It showed how handling ``ˈhændlɪŋ`` complaints effectively can turn a negative situation into a positive one. You know, I admired ``ədˈmaɪərd`` the mother’s determination ``dɪˌtɜːrmɪˈneɪʃən`` to get what she deserved ``dɪˈzɜːrvd`` and the waiter’s professionalism ``prəˈfɛʃənəlɪzəm`` in resolving `` ri'zɔlvɪŋ`` the problem.
