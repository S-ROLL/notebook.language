# Describe Sample
## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future 💼
When I was a child, I harbored ``'hɑ:bə`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I was thought about performing on stage and receiving ``rɪˈsiːvɪŋ`` applause ``əˈplɔːz``. However, as I grew older, my mindset changed ``tʃeɪndʒd``. It’s just dawned ``dɔːnd`` on me that being a singer isn't the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized ``ˈriːəlaɪzd`` that I'm not born to become a singer. I have no knack ``næk`` for singing and don't have the natural talent required ``rɪˈkwaɪərd`` to master in this field. Additionally, I don't have what it takes to become a successful singer. The dedication, vocal skills, and stage presence needed are beyond my capabilities ``ˌkeɪpəˈbɪlɪtiz``.

Moreover, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The long hours of practice and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming ``ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmɪŋ``. The lack of privacy makes me feel particularly ``pərˈtɪkjʊlɚli`` challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream, I have come to understand that it's not a suitable career choice for me.

## Describe an occasion when you heard someone complaining about something in a restaurant / store or other business places
Last summer, I witnessed a significant complaint while eating street food in Hanoi, specifically Bun Cha. It was around noon, in the heart of Hanoi’s Old Quarter, when a family sitting at the table next to mine showed dissatisfaction with their meal.

The mother made a complaint about the portions of grilled pork being too small and the dipping sauce being excessively salty. She insisted on getting a better portion and called the waiter over. The waiter apologized and assured her that he would bring a fresh batch of sauce and more pork.

The mother’s insistence paid off, but her initial reaction had clearly ticked her off. I could tell she got pissed off because nothing is more important than hygiene and quality when it comes to food. She made quite a fuss about it, complaining bitterly and using offensive language.

The waiter, however, remained calm and polite. He quickly addressed the issue, bringing a new serving that satisfied the family. The situation cooled down, and the family continued their meal without further issues.

This experience made me realize the importance of good customer service. It showed how handling complaints effectively can turn a negative situation into a positive one. Though I was initially uncomfortable with the intensity of the complaint, I admired the mother’s determination to get what she deserved and the waiter’s professionalism in resolving the issue.
