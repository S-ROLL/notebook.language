## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future ðŸ’¼
When I was a child, I harbored ``'hÉ‘:bÉ™`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I was captivated by the idea of performing on stage and receiving applause from an adoring audience. However, as I grew older, my mindset changed. Itâ€™s just dawned on me that being a singer is not the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized that I am not born to become a singer. I have no knack for singing and do not possess the natural talent required to excel in this field. Additionally, I do not have what it takes to become a successful singer. The dedication, vocal skills, and stage presence needed are beyond my capabilities.

Moreover, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The constant travel, long hours of practice, and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming. The lack of privacy and the need to always be in the spotlight are aspects that I find particularly challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream of mine, I have come to understand that it is not a suitable career choice for me due to my lack of natural talent, the demanding nature of the job, and the high level of stress involved.
