# Describe Sample
## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future 💼
When I was a child, I harbored ``'hɑ:bə`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I was thought about performing on stage and receiving ``rɪˈsiːvɪŋ`` applause ``əˈplɔːz``. However, as I grew older, my mindset changed ``tʃeɪndʒd``. It’s just dawned ``dɔːnd`` on me that being a singer isn't the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized ``ˈriːəlaɪzd`` that I'm not born to become a singer. I have no knack ``næk`` for singing and don't have the natural talent required ``rɪˈkwaɪərd`` to master in this field. Additionally, I don't have what it takes to become a successful singer. The dedication, vocal skills, and stage presence needed are beyond my capabilities ``ˌkeɪpəˈbɪlɪtiz``.

Moreover, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The long hours of practice and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming ``ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmɪŋ``. The lack of privacy makes me feel particularly ``pərˈtɪkjʊlɚli`` challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream, I have come to understand that it's not a suitable career choice for me.

## Describe an occasion when you heard someone complaining about something in a restaurant / store or other business places
Last summer, I witnessed a significant complaint while eating street food in Hanoi, specifically Bun Cha. It was around noon, in the heart of Hanoi’s Old Quarter, when a family sitting at the table next to mine showed dissatisfaction with their meal.

The mother made a complaint about the portions of grilled pork being too small and the unsanitary dipping sauce. She insisted on getting a better meal and called the waiter over. You know, luckily, the waiter apologized to her that he would bring a fresh of sauce and more pork.

You know, the mother's initial reaction had clearly ticked her off. I could tell she got pissed off because nothing is more important than hygiene and quality when it comes to food. The waiter, however, remained calm and polite.

This experience made me realize the importance of good customer service. It showed how handling complaints effectively can turn a negative situation into a positive one. You know, I admired the mother’s determination to get what she deserved and the waiter’s professionalism in resolving the issue.
