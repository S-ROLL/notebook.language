# Describe Sample
## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future 💼
Honestly, when I was a little child, I harbored ``ˈhɑːrbərd`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I've always fantasized ``'fæntəsaiz`` about performing on a big stage and receiving ``rɪˈsiːvɪŋ`` applause ``əˈplɔːz`` from the audience ``'ɔ:djəns``. However, as I grew older, you know, my mindset changed ``tʃeɪndʒd`` and It’s just dawned ``dɔːnd`` on me that being a singer isn't the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized ``ˈriːəlaɪzd`` that I'm not born to become a singer. I have no knack ``næk`` for singing, I don't have the natural talent, I wasn't born with a gift required ``rɪˈkwaɪərd`` to master a skill. I wanna say that I don't have what it takes to become a successful singer. You know, the dedication ``ˌdɛdɪˈkeɪʃən``, vocal skills, and stage presence ``ˈprɛzəns``, omg, that all needed are beyond my capabilities ``ˌkeɪpəˈbɪlɪtiz``.

In fact, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The long hours of practice and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming ``ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmɪŋ``. Specially, The lack of privacy makes me feel particularly ``pərˈtɪkjʊlɚli`` challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream, I have come to understand that it's not a suitable career choice for me.
### Task 3
Here are the paragraphs for each question using the provided sample structures:

1. **What kind of jobs do young people in your country like to do?**  
    Young people in my country are really into jobs in the tech industry, such as software development and digital marketing. These job are creativity ``ˌkriːeɪˈtɪvɪti``, innovation, and a dynamic work environment, it fit to the younger generation.

2. **Which one do young people prefer, an interesting job or a job with a high salary?**  
    It kinda depends on their priorities, but generally, young generations seem to like interesting jobs, it keeps them motivated and satisfied. However, for some, the practicality of a high salary is important, especially when you consider a strong financial.

3. **Do you think it is easier to get a job now than in the past?**  
    I would probably say it is easier to get a job now compared to the past. With the advancement of technology and the online platforms, you will have more opportunities. However, the competition has also increased, so the expectations `` ,ekspek'tei∫n`` for skills and qualifications are higher, making you more exicted to attempt.

4. **Do you think A.I (artificial intelligence) will take over many jobs?**  
    It kinda depends on the industry, but I believe A.I will take over many jobs. Fields like manufacturing and data processing are likely to see significant automation. However, jobs requiring creativity, critical thinking, and human interaction are less likely to be completely replaced by A.I.

## Describe an occasion when you heard someone complaining about something in a restaurant / store or other business places
Last summer, I witnessed ``ˈwɪtnɪst`` a significant complaint while eating street food in Hanoi, specifically ``spi'sifikəli`` Bun Cha. It was around noon, in the heart ``hɑ:t`` of Hanoi’s Old Quarter ``'kwɔ:tə``, when a family sitting at the table next to mine showed **dissatis**faction ``ˌdɪsˌsætɪsˈfækʃən`` with their meal.

The mother made a complaint about the portions ``ˈpɔːrʃənz`` of grilled ``ɡrɪld`` pork being too small and the unsanitary ``ʌnˈsænɪˌtɛri`` dipping sauce. She insisted on getting a better meal and called the waiter over. OMG! The situation is very tense; it was happening right next to me so I felt like I was about to get a heap of insults ``'insʌlt`` on me! At first in my mind, I thought the waiter would spit something dirty at her. But man! surprisingly, the waiter apologized ``əˈpɑːləˌdʒaɪzd`` to her that he would bring a fresh sauce and more pork.

Unbelievable! I feel that the mother's initial ``ɪˈnɪʃəl`` reaction had clearly ticked her off. I could tell she got pissed ``pɪst`` off because nothing is more important than hygiene ``ˈhaɪdʒiːn`` and quality when it comes to food.

This experience made me realize ``ˈriːəlaɪz`` the importance of good customer service. I admired ``ədˈmaɪərd`` the mother’s determination ``dɪˌtɜːrmɪˈneɪʃən`` to get what she deserved ``dɪˈzɜːrvd`` and the waiter’s professionalism ``prəˈfɛʃənəlɪzəm`` in resolving `` ri'zɔlvɪŋ`` the problem.
