# Describe Sample
## Describe a job that you do not like to do in the future 💼
When I was a child, I harbored ``'hɑ:bə`` a dream of becoming a singer. Like many kids, I was thought about performing on stage and receiving ``rɪˈsiːvɪŋ`` applause ``əˈplɔːz``. However, as I grew older, my mindset changed. It’s just dawned ``dɔːnd`` on me that being a singer isn't the right path for me.

Firstly, I realized ``ˈriːəlaɪzd`` that I'm not born to become a singer. I have no knack ``næk`` for singing and don't have the natural talent required to master in this field. Additionally, I don't have what it takes to become a successful singer. The dedication, vocal skills, and stage presence needed are beyond my capabilities ``ˌkeɪpəˈbɪlɪtiz``.

Moreover, the job of a singer is too physically and mentally demanding for me. The long hours of practice and the pressure to maintain a public image are overwhelming ``ˌoʊvərˈwɛlmɪŋ``. The lack of privacy makes me feel particularly ``pərˈtɪkjʊlɚli`` challenging.

In conclusion, while singing was a childhood dream, I have come to understand that it's not a suitable career choice for me.
