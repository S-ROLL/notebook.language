## `` Do you like (prefer) A or B ? ``
- **1 of the 2 options**
  - I would probably 😕 (definitely 💯) go for (opt for) ``paraphrasing / the former / the latter``
  - I'm more inclined 😗 to ``V``
  - I lean towards 😗 ``A/B``
- **It depends**
  - It kinda (sorta) depends 💁‍♂️
  - It depends (would depend) on + ``factor❗``
  - If ``case 1`` ➡️ ``A``, If ``case 2`` ➡️ ``B``
- **Neither**
  - Well, maybe (probably) neither of them 🙅‍♂️ ➡️ ``reasons + personal choice``
  - Could I say neither of them? 😉 ➡️ ``reasons + personal choice``
## Note
- Comparision / contrast language.
- Discuss both sides.
