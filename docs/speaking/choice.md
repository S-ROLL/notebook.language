### `` Do you like (prefer) A or B ? ``
- **1 of the 2 options**
    - I would probably 😕 (definitely 💯) go for (opt for) ``paraphrasing / the former / the latter``
    - I'm more inclined 😗 to ``V``
    - I lean towards 😗 ``A/B``
- **It depends**
    - It kinda (sorta) depends 💁‍♂️
    - It depends (would depend) on + ``factor❗``
    - If ``case 1`` ➡️ ``A``, If ``case 2`` ➡️ ``B``
- **Neither**
    - Well, maybe (probably) neither of them 🙅‍♂️ ➡️ ``reasons + personal choice``
    - Could I say neither of them? 😉 ➡️ ``reasons + personal choice``

!!! note
    - Comparision / contrast language.
