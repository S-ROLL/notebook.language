## PEN/PENCIL
**1. Which one do you often use: pen or pencil?**

I usually go for a pen because I like how it writes smoothly and clearly. I'm not really into pencils because they can smudge and need sharpening all the time. Pens make my notes look neat and tidy, which I find more satisfying.

**2. When was the last time you bought a pen or pencil?**

I recently bought a new pen because my old ones were running out of ink. It was just last week, actually. I wanted a pen that writes better and feels nicer, so I decided to get a new one that would last longer.

**3. How do you think if someone sends you a pen as a gift?**

If someone gave me a pen as a gift, I’d really like it. It shows they know I use pens a lot and think it’s a useful present. I would appreciate the thought behind it, especially if it’s a good pen that I can use every day.
## PHOTO
**1. Do you take photos by camera or phone?**

I usually take photos with my phone because it's always with me and easy to use. The camera quality on phones is pretty good these days, so I don't feel the need to carry a separate camera. It’s convenient and quick, which is perfect for capturing moments in the traveling.

**2. How do you deal with pictures after you take them?**

After I take pictures, I like to go through them and pick the best ones. I usually edit them a bit for better lighting or color and then save them on my phone or upload them to cloud storage. This way, I keep my favorites safe and can easily share them with friends or family.

**3. Do you want to learn photography to improve your skills of taking photos?**

Yes, I’d love to learn more about photography to improve my skills. I think knowing how to use lighting, angles, and settings properly can make a big difference in how photos turn out. It would be fun to take more creative and professional-looking pictures.

**4. How will people in the future take photos?**

I think in the future, people will continue to use their phones to take photos, but with even better technology. Cameras on phones will probably become more advanced, making it easier to take high-quality pictures. Maybe there will be new ways to capture moments, like with smart glasses or other wearable devices.

**5. Is it good to reserve photos in a cellphone?**

Yes, it’s good to store photos on a cellphone because it’s convenient and always with you. However, I also think it's important to back them up in case the phone gets lost or damaged. Using cloud storage or an external drive can help keep your photos safe and accessible.
## NUMBERS
**1. What numbers do you like?**

I like the number 7 because it feels lucky to me, and it often appears in many aspects of life, like days of the week or colors of the rainbow. There's something about it that just seems balanced and pleasing. I also like even numbers because they have a strong connected with an integer number.

**2. What numbers are important to you?**

Important numbers to me are my birthday, my family members' birthdays, and my phone number. These numbers have personal meaning and help me remember special dates or keep in touch with people I care about. I also think numbers related to my finances, like bank account numbers, are important.

**3. Can you remember phone numbers?**

I can remember a few phone numbers, mostly those of close family and friends. However, with smartphones storing all contacts, I don’t memorize as many as I used to. I usually rely on my phone to keep track of numbers now.

**4. Do you need to use numbers in the future?**

Yes, I think I will need to use numbers in the future, especially for finacial, planning, and any work-related tasks that involve data. Numbers are a part of everyday life, from checking prices while shopping to managing time and schedules. So, having good number skills will always be useful.

**5. Are you good at math?**

I would say I'm fairly fine at math. I enjoy solving problems and find math to be logical and satisfying. It helps me in many areas, like financial plan and understanding data, so I appreciate having a good grasp of it.
## SHARING
**1. Do you have anything to share with others recently?**

Yes, recently I shared some of my books with a friend who loves to read but didn’t have the chance to buy new ones. It felt great to share something I enjoy with someone else and to know they would appreciate it. Sharing things like books can help build connections and spread knowledge.

**2. Did your parents teach you to share when you were a child?**

Yes, my parents taught me the importance of sharing from a young age. They always encouraged me to share my toys and snacks with my siblings and friends. I think it helped me understand the value of generosity and how it brings people closer together.

**3. What kind of things do you like to share with others?**

I like to share food, books, and experiences with others. Sharing a meal or a good book can create meaningful conversations and memories. I also enjoy sharing my knowledge or skills, like helping someone with a task or teaching them something new.

**4. What kind of things are not suitable for sharing?**

Personal items like toothbrushes, towels, or any hygiene products are not suitable for sharing due to health reasons. Also, sensitive information, like personal passwords or private documents, should be kept to oneself to maintain privacy and security.
